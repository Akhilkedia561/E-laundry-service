The problem of paper wastage, time wastage, slips being lost for collecting clothes and improper arrangement of Laundry services has led to building a website that will make laundry services convenient. ðŸ’¡ Motivation Firstly, there were long lines where people had to stand to give their clothes for laundry servicing, this was altogether a very time-consuming process. Secondly, for writing the list of clothes the person uses a lot of paper which results in plenty of wastage of paper. The project aims to address problems with the current laundry system. Instead of using paper slips, the proposed solution involves creating a two-way website for collage and the laundry service. Students will input their laundry details on the website, and the laundry guy will record the data on his website. This online system will save time and reduce the risk of losing paper slips.
